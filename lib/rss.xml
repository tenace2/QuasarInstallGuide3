 <br><br><img alt="logos.png" src="quasarscaffold/logos.png"><br>Feb 2025<br><br>There are a number of steps you need to perform to properly scaffold and configure your Quasar-Capacitor project for creating Android apps using Vue.js.<br>This guide assumes, You Are:<br>
<br>Running VS Code IDE (though in general this should work with other IDEs).
<br>Familiar with Vue.js, as it is a foundation for Quasar.
<br>A beginner.
<br><br>I have attempted to show Information that has been directly gleaned from the internet and then "cut-n-pasted" incorporated into this guide between sets of lines and "Per research".<br>This guide is intended for someone who is starting out on their journey (like me). Experienced developers will likely find most of the information, well, superfluous.<br> Disclaimer &amp; Rant

There are very probably egregious errors, omissions, and mistakes in this guide. If you find them, blame a couple things:<br>
-The existing documentation on the Quasar and Capacitor websites (as of Feb 2025). 
--The Quasar web site does have info about Capacitor, but it's not very extensive, and it's difficult find any comprehensive implementations of a capacitor plugin out there on the internet.<br>
.  <a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli-vite/developing-capacitor-apps/introduction" target="_blank">https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli-vite/developing-capacitor-apps/introduction</a>   
--And the Capacitor website really doesn't have much to say about Quasar.  
If there was more documentation on how to properly integrate these two frameworks, I would not have found putting this guide together worth the effort in the first place.<br>
-Oh, and also blame the fact there is so much to learn about both Quasar, Capacitor and Vue!...and I'm just learning.
The following image pretty much captures the experience of trying to get a clean install of a Quasar-Capacitor-Android project: What a headache.

<br><br>Quasar and Capacitor are truly wonderful, but I've found it a bit difficult to get them to behave, so hence this guide.

Note of Why Quasar?<br>
Take the notes below with a grain-of-salt...some of it is pure opinion.  Do your own reasearch!
There are other frameworks out there besides Quasar that will help develop cross platform apps with one code base to target multiple platforms, such as Flutter, React Native, and Xamarin, and Ionic.<br>
<br>
Flutter is a Google thing...and Google simply abandons products without a second thought. I've been burned so many times relying on a Google platform or framework that simply disappeared, that I would never adopt anything they make unless forced too by their market monopoly power, such as Google Maps.<br>
<br>
React Native...well you have to learn React. But it supposedly renders native UI components instead of using WebView<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/cross-platform-frameworks.html" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/cross-platform-frameworks.html" target="_blank">1</a><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://appinventiv.com/blog/cross-platform-app-frameworks/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://appinventiv.com/blog/cross-platform-app-frameworks/" target="_blank">2</a>.&nbsp;This results in apps that are supposedly indistinguishable from those built using native languages like Objective-C or Java.<br>
<br>
.Xamarin... this is a Microsoft framework, requires C# and .NET. Yuck. I'd probably have to buy a windows machine. More Yuck. But, It compiles directly to native code, avoiding the use of WebView.<br>
<br>
Ionic looks pretty good, but it's just a javascript/typescript thing?  I don't really know, but as of 2025 it's more popular than Quasar, so that does say something.<br>
<br>
Quasar - so far, given that I'm primarily developing with Vue.js, I haven't found a better framework to develop in.<br>
<br>
Some more notes Per research further discussion:<br>
<br>
Ionic and Quasar are both popular frameworks for cross-platform app development, but they have some key differences:<br>
<br>
Performance and Rendering<br>
<br>
Ionic relies on WebView for app rendering, which can sometimes result in performance issues<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://stackshare.io/stackups/ionic-vs-quasar-framework" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://stackshare.io/stackups/ionic-vs-quasar-framework" target="_blank">1</a>.&nbsp;Quasar, on the other hand, takes advantage of platform-specific features, potentially offering better performance and a more native feel<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://stackshare.io/stackups/ionic-vs-quasar-framework" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://stackshare.io/stackups/ionic-vs-quasar-framework" target="_blank">1</a>.
 Challenges of WebView-Based Frameworks

<br>
Performance Limitations: WebViews may not match the speed or responsiveness of fully native apps due to additional rendering layers<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15024400/is-it-useful-using-webview-whole-layout-in-native-android-app" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15024400/is-it-useful-using-webview-whole-layout-in-native-android-app" target="_blank">2</a><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://felgo.com/mobile-app-framework-comparison" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://felgo.com/mobile-app-framework-comparison" target="_blank">4</a>.

<br>
Device Compatibility Issues: Variations in WebView implementations across operating systems can lead to inconsistent behavior<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://felgo.com/mobile-app-framework-comparison" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://felgo.com/mobile-app-framework-comparison" target="_blank">4</a>.

<br>
Limited Access to Native Features: While plugins can bridge some gaps, certain advanced device functionalities may not be accessible<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15024400/is-it-useful-using-webview-whole-layout-in-native-android-app" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15024400/is-it-useful-using-webview-whole-layout-in-native-android-app" target="_blank">2</a><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38157790/are-ios-android-apps-with-webview-only-considered-hybrid-or-web-apps" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38157790/are-ios-android-apps-with-webview-only-considered-hybrid-or-web-apps" target="_blank">6</a>.

<br>
User Experience Concerns: Apps relying heavily on WebViews may feel less fluid compared to native applications<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.mobiloud.com/blog/native-app-vs-webview-app" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.mobiloud.com/blog/native-app-vs-webview-app" target="_blank">7</a>.
 Platform Support
While Ionic primarily focuses on hybrid mobile applications, Quasar targets a broader range of platforms including mobile (iOS, Android) using Capacitor, desktop (Windows, Mac, Linux) using Electron, and web applications including SPA and SSR <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://stackshare.io/stackups/ionic-vs-quasar-framework" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://stackshare.io/stackups/ionic-vs-quasar-framework" target="_blank">1</a><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.bacancytechnology.com/blog/quasar-framework-full-frontend-stack" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.bacancytechnology.com/blog/quasar-framework-full-frontend-stack" target="_blank">2</a>.
 UI Components and Design
Ionic offers pre-built UI components following Material Design and Apple's Human Interface Guidelines<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://stackshare.io/stackups/ionic-vs-quasar-framework" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://stackshare.io/stackups/ionic-vs-quasar-framework" target="_blank">1</a>. (Ionic seems to have an Apple bias)<br>
Quasar provides a more extensive set of components and styling options, offering both Material Design and iOS-style components<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://stackshare.io/stackups/ionic-vs-quasar-framework" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://stackshare.io/stackups/ionic-vs-quasar-framework" target="_blank">1</a><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.bacancytechnology.com/blog/quasar-framework-full-frontend-stack" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.bacancytechnology.com/blog/quasar-framework-full-frontend-stack" target="_blank">2</a>.
 Framework Base
Ionic can be used with various JavaScript frameworks, while Quasar is built specifically on Vue.js, offering seamless integration with Vue's ecosystem<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://stackshare.io/stackups/ionic-vs-quasar-framework" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://stackshare.io/stackups/ionic-vs-quasar-framework" target="_blank">1</a><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-quasar-framework-why-leading-among-other-javascript-maitri-patel-qu1ef" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-quasar-framework-why-leading-among-other-javascript-maitri-patel-qu1ef" target="_blank">3</a>.
Development Experience
Quasar is often praised for its comprehensive toolset, which includes a wide range of UI components, layout elements, and helpers<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.bacancytechnology.com/blog/quasar-framework-full-frontend-stack" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.bacancytechnology.com/blog/quasar-framework-full-frontend-stack" target="_blank">2</a>.&nbsp;It also offers features like code splitting, lazy loading, and server-side rendering out of the box<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.bacancytechnology.com/blog/quasar-framework-full-frontend-stack" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.bacancytechnology.com/blog/quasar-framework-full-frontend-stack" target="_blank">2</a>.
 Community and Ecosystem
Ionic has a larger, more established community with extensive documentation and a broad range of plugins<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://stackshare.io/stackups/ionic-vs-quasar-framework" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://stackshare.io/stackups/ionic-vs-quasar-framework" target="_blank">1</a>.&nbsp;
Quasar, while newer, has a growing community and offers a collection of ready-to-use plugins and integrations<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://stackshare.io/stackups/ionic-vs-quasar-framework" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://stackshare.io/stackups/ionic-vs-quasar-framework" target="_blank">1</a><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-quasar-framework-why-leading-among-other-javascript-maitri-patel-qu1ef" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-quasar-framework-why-leading-among-other-javascript-maitri-patel-qu1ef" target="_blank">3</a>.
 Performance Optimization
Quasar emphasizes performance with built-in features like code minification, source mapping, and tree shaking<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.bacancytechnology.com/blog/quasar-framework-full-frontend-stack" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.bacancytechnology.com/blog/quasar-framework-full-frontend-stack" target="_blank">2</a>.
 Customization and Theming
Quasar offers more extensive theming capabilities, including support for right-to-left (RTL) languages<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.bacancytechnology.com/blog/quasar-framework-full-frontend-stack" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.bacancytechnology.com/blog/quasar-framework-full-frontend-stack" target="_blank">2</a>.
In summary, while various frameworks have their strengths, Quasar seems to offer more flexibility in terms of platform support and potentially better performance, especially for Vue.js developers. However, Ionic's larger community and ecosystem might be advantageous for some projects.

<br>Oh, and some credits are at the end...<br><br><br>There are 3 steps:<br>
-have Node, nvm and npm installed<br>
-verify Android Studio install<br>
-set android environment variables<br><br>First, let's verify the development environment<br>==Important DO NOT IGNORE:  ==<br>
As of Feb 2025, default Quasar &amp; Capacitor (v6) required Node v18.<br>
This will probably change, hence why having node version manager (nvm) is essential.<br>Terminal commands:<br>node --version  # Should be &gt;=18.0.0
npm --version   # Should be &gt;=6.13.4
nvm --version   # Check if nvm is installed
<br>If nvm is not installed:<br># For macOS using brew
brew install nvm
<br>After installation, add these lines to your ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile:<br>export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/nvm.sh" ] &amp;&amp; \. "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/nvm.sh"
[ -s "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/etc/bash_completion.d/nvm" ] &amp;&amp; \. "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/etc/bash_completion.d/nvm"
<br>Reload your terminal configuration:<br>source ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bash_profile
<br>Verify nvm installation:<br>nvm --version
<br>If Node.js version is not 18:<br># Install Node.js 18
nvm install 18

# Use Node.js 18
nvm use 18

# Verify the version
node --version  # Should show v18.x.x (for Capacitor v6)
<br>To use a specific version directly, use the terminal command:<br>nvm use &lt;version&gt;
<br>Per research NPM - NPX:

npm and npx are both tools used in Node.js development, but they serve different purposes:<br>
npm (Node Package Manager)

<br>Used for installing and managing packages in Node.js projects
<br>Primarily handles package installation, either locally or globally
<br>Manages dependencies listed in the package.json file
<br>Requires packages to be installed before they can be used
<br>Usage: npm install &lt;package&gt;

npx (Node Package Execute)

<br>Executes Node.js packages without requiring installation
<br>Allows running packages directly from the npm registry
<br>Ideal for one-time or infrequent package usage18
<br>Can run different versions of packages without conflicts
<br>Usage: npx &lt;package&gt;


I have more notes in some section <a data-href="#Part 3F - Sync Your Project" href="about:blank#Part_3F_-_Sync_Your_Project" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Part 3F - Sync Your Project</a> on npx
<br>Per research: Node Modules

The node_modules folder plays a crucial role in your Quasar and Capacitor project, as it does in most Node.js-based applications:
Dependency Storage:<br>
node_modules is where all the external libraries and packages that your project depends on are stored15. This includes Quasar, Capacitor, and any other packages you've installed using npm or yarn.
Local Package Access:<br>
When you import a package in your code, Node.js looks for it in the node_modules folder1. This allows your application to use these dependencies without needing to specify their full path.
Project-Specific Dependencies:<br>
Each project has its own node_modules folder, ensuring that different projects can use different versions of the same package without conflicts.
Automatic Management:<br>
When you run npm install or yarn install, the package manager reads your package.json file and downloads all the required dependencies into the node_modules folder.
Exclusion from Version Control:<br>
The node_modules folder is typically not included in version control systems like Git due to its large size35. Instead, developers share the package.json file, which lists all the dependencies.
Recreating Dependencies:<br>
Other developers can recreate the node_modules folder on their machines by running npm install or yarn install, using the package.json as a reference.
For Quasar and Capacitor specifically:

<br>These frameworks, along with their dependencies, are stored in node_modules when you set up your project
<br>When you add Capacitor plugins to your Quasar project, they are installed into the node_modules folder
<br>Remember, if you're having issues with missing modules after cloning a repository or switching branches, try deleting the node_modules folder and package-lock.json file, then running npm install again to ensure all dependencies are correctly installed4


<br><br>Open Android Studio and verify the following:<br>Go to Tools &gt; SDK Manager<br>
Under "SDK Platforms" ensure you have:<br>
<br>Android 14.0 (API 34) or latest stable
<br>Android 13.0 (API 33)
<br>Under "SDK Tools" verify you have:<br>
<br>Android SDK Build-Tools
<br>Android SDK Command-line Tools
<br>Android Emulator
<br>Android SDK Platform-Tools
<br><br>Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile:<br>export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
<br>How to set up your environment variables for newbies
Following is on a MacBook<br>
Here’s how to do it:
1. Open Terminal.
2. Open your&nbsp;.zshrc&nbsp;file in a text editor.<br>
You can use&nbsp;nano, which is simple and built-in:
nano ~/.zshrc

.<br>
3. Add the lines shown above to the end of the file
4. Save and close the file.<br>
If using&nbsp;nano, press&nbsp;Control + X, then&nbsp;Y&nbsp;to confirm, and&nbsp;Enter&nbsp;to save.<br>
.<br>
To apply these changes immediately after editing .zshrc, run:
source ~/.zshrc

This will reload your shell configuration and make the environment variables available in your current terminal session.
<br>What environment variables do
What These Lines Do:
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk:

<br>Sets the ANDROID_HOME environment variable to the directory where the Android SDK is installed
<br>The ANDROID_HOME variable is used by many Android tools to locate the SDK
<br>Tools like Gradle, Android Studio, and command-line utilities rely on this variable

export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:

<br>Appends the tools directory inside the Android SDK to your system's PATH
<br>Allows you to run commands like android from any location without typing the full path

export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:

<br>Appends the platform-tools directory to your system's PATH
<br>Contains essential utilities like adb (Android Debug Bridge) and fastboot

Why This Is Important:

<br>Makes Android development tools easily accessible from the command line
<br>Eliminates need to type full paths to tools
<br>Essential for tasks like building apps, managing emulators, or debugging devices

How It Works in Practice:<br>
After adding these lines to your .zshrc, you can:

<br>Use commands like adb devices or emulator -avd &lt;avd_name&gt; directly
<br>Run Gradle builds or other tasks that depend on the Android SDK

<br><br>Before you begin scaffolding Quasar, think carefully about the following names: <br>
<br>Directory &amp; Name
<br>Product Name
<br>App ID
<br>Capacitor AppName
<br>Notes on naming

Plan the naming of your project name-directory-folder.

<br>You will be using cd a lot, so don't get too carried away: keep it simple
<br>This will also be the "name" in your root package.json file
<br>This is typically lowercase, no spaces
<br>Used for the project directory and npm package name
<br>Best practice: Use kebab-case (e.g., "my-map-app") or single words


Product Name ("productName" in root package.json):

<br>This is the user-friendly display name
<br>Can include spaces and proper capitalization
<br>This often appears in the app launcher, title bar, etc.


Capacitor App ID (appId in capacitor.config.json):

<br>Should follow reverse domain name notation
<br>Format: com.company.appname
<br>In my case I used a GitHub Pages domain: "io.github.abcdefg.googlemap"
<br>Best practice: Use a domain you control
<br>This is important for app stores and must be unique
<br>Even if you are creating an Android app, you could still launch a test as a spa


Capacitor App Name (appName in capacitor.config.json):

<br>Usually matches the productName in package.json
<br>This is what shows under the app icon

Follow the steps sequentially to ensure proper setup of your development environment.<br><br>In your project directory, first check the install of the Quasar CLI: <br>quasar --version
<br>The above command will return the CLI version if installed, something like:<br>@quasar/cli 2.4.1
<br>Run the Quasar CLI install command if not already installed:<br>npm i -g @quasar/cli
<br>Note also that you can run the following command:<br>quasar info

-Create Quasar project<br>
-Install and verify<br>
-Test initial build<br><br>Run this command:<br>npm init quasar@latest
<br>Or run this command:<br>npm create quasar
<br>The above command seems to take a long time to run...you just have to wait.<br>As of Feb 2025, I can't determine definitively which of the above commands is better.   Either command will then prompt the same set of selection options: see note below. <br>If npm hangs
The command "npm init quasar@latest" will often hang on this last step:
✔ Install project dependencies? (recommended) › Yes, use npm

It may fail with this message:
npm error code UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY
npm error errno UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY
npm error request to https://registry.npmjs.org/@eslint%2fjs failed, reason: unable to get local issuer certificate

When this happens, you'll see:
Quasar • ⚠️  Could not auto install dependencies. Probably a temporary npm registry issue?
Quasar • Initialized Git repository 🚀

To get started:
`cd yourprojectfolder`

<br>Quasar Project Structure
After running npm init quasar@latest your project structure should look something like this:
your-project/

Running quasar mode add capacitor will probably default in older versions of capacitor (v6), as shown in the package.json in /src-capacitor folder (as of Feb 2025).  But by the time you read this, who knows?  You will just have to fight the version dependency battle.
Research indicates the Quasar team have the command quasar mode add capacitor default in a supposedly more stable versions of capacitor at v6 (but Capacitor plugins, as of Feb 2025, are at v7)
The version is crucial!<br>
Subsequent steps to install @capacitor/android and other capacitor plugins can run into version issues, because version 7 of @capacitor/android will default in, which will conflict with @capacitor/core at v6.
You may see an error msg such as this:
[warn] @capacitor/core@6.2.0 version doesn't match @capacitor/android@7.0.1 version.
Consider updating to a matching version, e.g. w/ npm install @capacitor/core@7.0.1

Attempts to upgrade capacitor/core might drag you down a rabbit hole of chained updates to your entire project, including Node.js.
It appears that (as of Feb 2025) Capacitor v6 requires Node v18. 
-But Capacitor v7 requires Node v20. 
-But Node v20 doesn't apparently work with the Quasar version that is defaulted in my npm create quasar.
So I recommend avoiding to attempts to upgrade individually.  And note: I was never able to land a clean working v7 Capacitor into my Quasar project.  Again: there seems to be no comprehensive versioning guide to install a Node-Vue-Quasar-Capacitor-Android-plugin stack. 
here's some links to other notes ranting about version dependencies:<br>

<br>Notes on Quasar Install vs NPM install
Running command quasar mode add capacitor in project root does of course negate the need to run specific NPM commands in a /src-capacitor folder:

<br>npm install @capacitor/core
<br>and
<br>npm install @capacitor/cli

Per research:

Running "quasar mode add capacitor" does more than just installing the Capacitor core package.<br>
Here's why it's important:

<br>It sets up the Capacitor integration within your Quasar project structure.
<br>It creates a dedicated "/src-capacitor" folder in your Quasar project, which contains the necessary configuration files for Capacitor.
<br>It automatically adds platform-specific folders (ios and android) to your project root when you add those platforms.
<br>It configures your Quasar project to work seamlessly with Capacitor, including setting up build processes and development scripts.
<br>It ensures compatibility between Quasar and Capacitor versions, reducing potential conflicts.

Simply running "npm install @capacitor/core" (in project root) would only install the core package without integrating it properly into your Quasar project structure or setting up the necessary configurations. The "quasar mode add capacitor" command provides a more comprehensive and streamlined setup for using Capacitor with Quasar

Rant Alert: But, why running "quasar mode add capacitor" also does not update the package.json and node_mooules in the Quasar project root is simply inexplicable and exasperating.  It should, as this just creates extra steps and opportunities for error and confusion.
<br>Warning Notes on npx cap init
If your floundering around the internet attempting to figure out how to land a clean install of Quasar-Capacitor-Android, you will probably come across the cmnd:
npx cap init

This command npx cap init will create a completely new scaffold of your project right on-top of everything you've done with "quasar mode add capacitor". Thus you will either duplicate files and directories, or over-write files and directories...either way it's kind-of-mess. If using quasar to install capacitor, I recommend avoiding also using "npx cap init".
<br>Recommend Examine Capacitor Project Structure &amp; package.json
At the end of scaffolding capacitor when using the Quasar command quasar mode add capacitor, the project structure should look something like this:
your-project/
├── .quasar
├── node_modules
├── src/
├── src-capacitor/        &lt;- new folder created
│   ├── node_modules   &lt;- more node_modules
│   ├── www
│   ├── capacitor.config.json
│   ├── package-lock.json
│   └── package.json      &lt;- Yet another package.json file!
├── index.html
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
└── quasar.config.js

The package.json file under /src-capactor folder should look something like this:
{
"name": "gmap9",
"version": "0.0.1",
"description": "A Quasar Google Map test",
"author": "abcdefg2 &lt;abcdefg2@icloud.com&gt;",
"private": true,
"dependencies": {
   "@capacitor/app": "^6.0.0",     &lt;- v6!!!
   "@capacitor/cli": "^6.0.0",     &lt;- v6!!!
  "@capacitor/core": "^6.0.0".    &lt;- v6!!!
}
}

Special Note: Notice above that Quasar defaulted in v6 capacitor!!!
<br>Notes regarding capacitor app, core and cli
Each of the files perform different function (duh)
@capacitor/app<br>
This is a specific Capacitor plugin that provides functionality related to the app itself.<br>
It offers methods for handling app-level events and information, such as:

<br>Detecting when the app is put into the background or brought to the foreground  
<br>Accessing app information like build and version numbers 
<br>Handling deep links  
<br>Managing app exit events<br>
It's an optional plugin that you can add to your project for additional app-specific functionality.<br>
NOTE: @capacitor/app does not need a separate install step in the root package.json.

@capacitor/core:<br>
This is the main package that provides the core functionality and APIs for Capacitor.<br>
It contains the JavaScript runtime that allows web apps to interact with native platform features.<br>
It's used in your web application code to access Capacitor's APIs and plugins.<br>
It provides a consistent API layer that works across all platforms (iOS, Android, and web).<br>
NOTE: @capacitor/core  does need  a separate step to install in the root package.json
@capacitor/cli<br>
The @capacitor/cli is the Command Line Interface for Capacitor, a crucial tool for managing Capacitor projects. It provides several key functionalities:
Project initialization: The CLI allows you to initialize new Capacitor projects with the "npx cap init" command<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/ionic-team/capacitor" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://github.com/ionic-team/capacitor" target="_blank">5</a>.
. Platform management: It enables adding native platforms to your project, such as iOS and Android, using commands like "npx cap add android" or "npx cap add ios"<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/ionic-team/capacitor" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://github.com/ionic-team/capacitor" target="_blank">5</a>.
. Project synchronization: The CLI facilitates syncing your web app with native projects using "npx cap sync"<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://app.studyraid.com/en/read/11146/345586/definition-and-purpose-of-capacitor" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://app.studyraid.com/en/read/11146/345586/definition-and-purpose-of-capacitor" target="_blank">1</a>.
Plugin management: It helps in adding, removing, and updating Capacitor plugins<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://ionic.zone/capacitor/overview" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://ionic.zone/capacitor/overview" target="_blank">3</a>.
 Build and run: The CLI assists in building and running your app on different platforms<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://ionic.zone/capacitor/overview" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://ionic.zone/capacitor/overview" target="_blank">3</a>.
Project configuration: It allows you to manage and update your project's configuration settings<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://ionic.zone/capacitor/overview" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://ionic.zone/capacitor/overview" target="_blank">3</a>.
Code copying: The CLI handles copying your web app's code to native platforms and updating plugin code in native projects<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://ionic.zone/capacitor/overview" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://ionic.zone/capacitor/overview" target="_blank">3</a>.
 NOTE: @capacitor/cli  does need  a separate step to install in the root package.json
The Capacitor CLI is typically installed as a development dependency in your project, ensuring that different projects can use different CLI versions if needed**
<br>Notes on capacitor.config.json file.
The capacitor.config.json file will probably initially look something like this:
{
"appId": "com.abcdefg2.org",
"appName": "My Gmap9 Test",
"webDir": "www"
}

The webDir will probably need to be changed at some point to "dist/spa".<br>
The dist/spa directory is created in a following step.<br>
As far as I can determine, the "www" is a default webpack configuration,<br>
and "dist/spa" is a Quasar thing.
If you don't change the webDir, you will might get a common bug that results in a white-screen on android.
There is a specific section, Part 3 E Create /dist directory which will discuss the webDir in more detail.
<br><br>You MUST manually install the @capacitor/cli and the @capacitor/core modules in the project root!  ***Make sure root install matches the version in /scr-capacitor<br>Change directories to your project root.<br>In your project root directory first run:<br>npm install @capacitor/cli@6
<br>Then run:<br>npm install @capacitor/core@6
<br>Important Notes on CLI &amp; Core in Root
CRUCIAL!!!     DO NOT IGNORE THIS NOTE!!!<br>
Add Capacitor cli and core to the package.json file in Root Directory for Vite web build.
Running "quasar mode add capacitor" in the root directory only creates src-capacitor folder and the capacitor related files configurations in the /src-capcitor directory.
The command "quasar mode add capacitor" does not however update the package.json file or update the node_modules in the project root, which turns out to be (as of Feb 2025) absolutely crucial.
Per research:

Point 1<br>
Why@capacitor/core Must Be Installed in the Root of the Quasar Project.
Ensures Compatibility with Quasar's Web Build System

<br>Quasar's frontend relies on Webpack (or Vite) for bundling the application.
<br>The Capacitor plugins and API calls (import { Camera } from '@capacitor/camera') are part of this web build process.
<br>If @capacitor/core is not in root node_modules, Quasar's Webpack build may not resolve, leading to "module not found" errors.


Point 2: Install in Project Root? Or just in /src-capacitor?
 Which capacitor plugins features-plugins-components-api (what ever you want to call them) do you need to install in the project root so it just updates the root package.json and the node_modules?
And which capacitor plugins to only install into the /src-capacitor folder so it only updates the package.json file and node_modules in the /src-capacitor folder?
It turns out this is nearly pure guess-work.
There is no definitive chart or guide. As of Feb 2025, here's a little bit of what I've learned through arduous trial and error and endless floundering around on the internet.
The heuristic rule of thumb seems to be:

<br>Native? or not Native?<br>
If the capacitor feature is going to exercise native phone features, such as haptics or camera, only install in just /src-capacitor.

Examples:<br>
Install in both project root and src-capacitor:

<br>@capacitor/core
<br>@capacitor/geolocation

Install in just /src-capacitor:

<br>@capacitor/android

<br>Recommend ReExamine Root package.json
The package.json file dependencies in the project root should subsequently look something like the json file below.  Note the addition of the capacitor cli and core.
{
"dependencies": {
  "@capacitor/cli": "^6.2.0",  &lt;- match package.json in src-capacitor
  "@capacitor/core": "^6.2.0", &lt;- match package.json in src-capacitor
  "@quasar/extras": "^1.16.4",
  "axios": "^1.2.1",
  "pinia": "^3.0.1",
  "quasar": "^2.16.0",
  "vue": "^3.4.18",
  "vue-router": "^4.0.0"
},
 "devDependencies": {
  "@eslint/js": "^9.14.0",
   "@quasar/app-vite": "^2.1.0",
  "autoprefixer": "^10.4.2",
   "eslint": "^9.14.0",
   "eslint-plugin-vue": "^9.30.0",
   "globals": "^15.12.0",
   "postcss": "^8.4.14",
   "vite-plugin-checker": "^0.8.0"
 }
}

<br><br>Check the capacitor CLI version in project root:<br>npx cap --version
<br>Change directories into the /src-capacitor folder:<br>cd src-capacitor
<br>Then run to check capacitor in /src-capacitor:<br>npm list @capacitor/core
<br>The capacitor core version, which should match package.json.<br><br>Now we can start configuring things to actually create an Android app.  These steps will allow Android Studio to launch.<br>NOTE: The @capacitor/android is native and only needs installed in the /src-capacitor folder.<br>The install of capacitor android is a two step process.  As an analogy: think about this as repairing your car:<br>
<br>First go to the parts store and get the car parts (install android).
<br>And then you actually bolt the parts to the car (create android).
<br><br>The step is like going to the automotive store to get your car parts.<br>Be sure and change directories into the /src-capacitor directory-folder:<br>cd src-capacitor
<br>then<br>npm install @capacitor/android@6.0.0
<br>The package.json file in /src-capacitor folder should then look something like this:<br>{
  "name": "gmap9",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "A Quasar Google Map test",
  "author": "abcdefg2 &lt;abcdefg2@icloud.com&gt;",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "@capacitor/android": "^6.0.0",   &lt;- android added
    "@capacitor/app": "^6.0.0",
    "@capacitor/cli": "^6.0.0",
    "@capacitor/core": "^6.0.0"
  }
}
<br><br>Notes about capacitor android versioning
Warning Note:<br>
Just running the following will default in android v7.
npm install @capacitor/android

This v7 android will conflict with the the v6 capacitor/core that Quasar defaulted.
Check your package.json file in /src-capacitor
Run following command to stay compatible with package.json versions in src-capacitor folder, if of course your cli and core are at v6:
npm install @capacitor/android@6.0.0

Here is a link to the official Capacitor documentation on the @capacitor/android package, (and it really doesn't tell you much about versioning):<br>
<a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://capacitorjs.com/docs/android#adding-the-android-platform" target="_blank">https://capacitorjs.com/docs/android#adding-the-android-platform</a>
<br>Note: just add android to /src-capacitor

Per research:

Unlike @capacitor/core, which is needed in both the web and native contexts, @capacitor/android is a native platform package that is only needed by the Android project inside src-capacitor.
🚨 Problems If Installed in the Root:

<br>Not Needed for Web Builds: The root Quasar project does not need @capacitor/android, as it does not run any Android-specific code.
<br>Potential Dependency Conflicts: Installing @capacitor/android at the root can sometimes cause conflicts when running npx cap sync, as Capacitor expects platform dependencies inside src-capacitor.


<br>Notes on native runtime
Per research:

Why @capacitor/whateverplugin usually needs to be Installed In just /src-capacitor:
(a) Native Runtime Dependency for Capacitor's Native Code

<br>The src-capacitor directory is where Capacitor's native project (Android/iOS) is initialized.
<br>The native build system (gradle for Android, CocoaPods for iOS) may require @capacitor/core to be present.
<br>When you run npx cap sync, it scans src-capacitor to gather necessary dependencies for native builds.

(b) Ensures Proper Dependency Resolution for Native Plugins<br>
Some Capacitor plugins rely on @capacitor/core being locally available inside src-capacitor to properly initialize.

<br>If @capacitor/core missing, commands like npx cap sync or npx cap run could have errors where native plugins cannot find Capacitor core runtime

(c) There are exceptions (of course) to installing plugins in the project root: native platform package. (meaning: if the plugin is native android, probably don't install in project root).

<br><br>This step is like actually bolting the car parts to your car.<br>Run the following in the /src-capacitor folder:<br>npx cap add android
<br>The above command npx cap add android will actually create the /android folder-directory within the /src-capacitor folder.<br>When you run npx cap add android, Capacitor is looking at the capacitor.config.json file.<br>your-project/

<br><br>Android Project Structure Detail
Note 1: Android Project Structure
Inside the /src-capacitor folder:<br>
After running npx cap add android, the generated /android folder follows a standard Android project structure that should look something like this:
android/
├── app/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── main/
│   │   │   ├── java/com/example/app/
│   │   │   │   ├── MainActivity.kt
│   │   │   ├── AndroidManifest.xml   &lt;- update capacitor plugins
│   │   │   ├── res/
│   │   │   │   ├── drawable/
│   │   │   │   ├── layout/
│   │   │   │   ├── mipmap/
│   │   │   │   ├── values/
├── build.gradle
├── settings.gradle

When you install a capacitor plugin you will probably need to manually update permission within the AndroidManifest.xml file.
<br>MainActivity file
Note 2: The MainActivity.kt File (Entry Point)
This is the Kotlin (kt) language for Android...you might default in Java. Either will work.
Located at:<br>
src-capacitor/android/app/src/main/java/com/example/app/MainActivity.kt
This file extends BridgeActivity, which is provided by Capacitor:
package com.example.app
import com.getcapacitor.BridgeActivity
class MainActivity : BridgeActivity() {
}

What The above Means:

<br>BridgeActivity is a Capacitor-provided class that acts as the bridge between the web code (your Quasar app) and the native Android layer.
<br>This is where Capacitor loads the web content (index.html from your Quasar build).
<br>You can extend this class to register additional native plugins.

<br> AndroidManifest.xml file
Note 3: AndroidManifest.xml (Native Configuration)
Located at:<br>
/src-capacitor/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
This file configures important settings like:

<br>Permissions (e.g., Camera, Geolocation)
<br>App name, package name
<br>Main activity that launches on startup

Example snippet below (please excuse the tick mark escape characters):<br>
Note again when adding plugins, you will probably need to update permissions:
`&lt;uses-permission...&gt;

`&lt;manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"&gt;
`&lt;package="com.example.app"&gt;`
	
	 `&lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" /&gt;`

	`&lt;application
		 android:allowBackup="true"
		android:theme="@style/AppTheme"&gt;
		`&lt;activity
			android:name=".MainActivity"
			 android:launchMode="singleTask"
			android:theme="@style/AppTheme.NoActionBar"&gt;
			 `&lt;intent-filter&gt;				
			 `&lt;action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" /&gt;
			 &lt;/intent-filter&gt;
		 `&lt;/activity&gt;
	 `&lt;/application&gt;
`&lt;/manifest&gt;`

<br>Kotlin or Java File

 My understanding of how Java is integrated into this architecture is sketchy at best. You do need to be sensitive to the versions of the JDK, JVM and Kotlin. Things can go wrong and you might be forced to fiddle directly with gradle files, which are way down inside the node modules. Do your own research!
Per some of my research:

If you install native plugins (e.g., Camera, Filesystem), Capacitor will automatically integrate them.<br>
For example, if you install the capacitor camera plugin:
npm install @capacitor/camera
npx cap sync

It will register in Kotlin automatically. If needed, you can manually add them to MainActivity.kt:
import com.getcapacitor.BridgeActivity
import com.getcapacitor.Plugin
import com.getcapacitor.community.camera.CameraPlugin

class MainActivity : BridgeActivity() {
  init {
      registerPlugin(CameraPlugin::class.java)
  }
}


<br><br>Verify installation in the /src-capacitor folder:<br>npm list @capacitor/android
ls android/  # Should show complete Android project structure
<br>How Android Works in a Quasar/Capacitor App:

<br>
Your Quasar app runs inside a WebView on the Android.

<br>
Capacitor provides a JavaScript-to-Native bridge, allowing Quasar to interact with the native Android layer.

<br>
Note: some developers do not like WebView for various reasons, such as performance.  

<br>
Kotlin is only used when you need to modify native functionality (e.g., adding custom plugins or tweaking the Android behavior).


<br><br>Additionally, there is yet another step:<br>
<br>Create a /dist directory
<br>To build your Quasar app for production generate the /dist directory with terminal command in the root directory:<br>quasar build
<br>This will create a new /dist directory:<br>your-project/
├── .quasar
├── dist/spa             &lt;- new dist directory
├── node_modules
├── src/
├── src-capacitor/
├── index.html
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
└── quasar.config.js
<br>Then Very Important!<br>
Update the capacitor.config.json file!!!<br>
In your /src-capacitor folder, it must to point to the correct web directory:<br>
"webDir": "../dist/spa"<br>The capacitor.config.json file should look something like this:<br>
{<br>
"appId": "com.yoururl.gmap",<br>
"appName": "quasargooglemap",<br>
"webDir": "../dist/spa"<br>
}<br>Notes on dist/spa
Notes: per my research here's an explanation for the above step regarding dist/spa:

When you scaffolded your project using quasar mode add capacitor, it defaulted to "www" instead of "dist/spa" for historical and compatibility reasons.
The "www" directory is a common default for many web-based mobile frameworks, including Cordova, which Capacitor was designed to be compatible with. This default setting allows for easier migration from Cordova projects and maintains consistency with other hybrid mobile development tools.
However, Quasar's build process typically outputs to the "dist/spa" directory for Single Page Applications. This mismatch between Quasar's output and Capacitor's default expectation is why you need to manually update the webDir in the capacitor.config.json file.
To align Capacitor with Quasar's build output, you should change the webDir setting in your capacitor.config.json
If you do not run "quasar build", and just launch a dev server locally, you can probably keep "webDir": "www" in capacitor.config.json file.

<br><br>Now sync your project with Capacitor to ensure everything is up-to-date run command in the src-capacitor directory:<br>cd src-capacitor
npx cap sync
<br>Sync Details - What npx cap sync does

Run npx cap sync in the /src-capacitor folder to synchronize your web app with the Capacitor project.<br>
This command does two things:

<br>Copies your web assets to the native platforms
<br>Updates native plugins and dependencies

The npx cap sync command relies on the capacitor.config.json file (in /src-capaitor folder), which contains the following crucial piece of information:
   `"webDir": "dist/spa"`

The npx cap sync command is crucial because it:

<br>
Copies the latest web assets from your specified webDir to the native platform folders.

<br>
Updates Capacitor and Cordova plugins, ensuring all native dependencies are in place.
Do Not Run npx cap sync In Project root.<br>
Note that if you run npx cap sync in the project root directory, you will get an error, because the root directory does not have a capacitor.config.json file.

The error message seems rather confusing,<br>
It should  probably say something like:<br>
"Yo dummy, I couldn't find the capacitor.config.json file so I couldn't do anything. <br>
But if you read the error msg carefully it has a clue.



error Could not find the web assets directory: ./www. Please create it and make sure it has an index.html file. You can change the path of this directory in capacitor.config.json (webDir option). You may need to compile the web assets for your app (typically npm run build). More info: https://capacitorjs.com/docs/basics/workflow#sync-your-project
The clue in the above error is the command npx cap sync looking for the webDir (aka web assets directory) in the capacitor.config.json file, which is only in the /src-capacitor folder to create the web assets (for use in the WebView)<br>
<br>
Per Research: More tedious details:<br>
The command npx cap sync is responsible for synchronizing your web app with the native platforms (Android/iOS). Specifically, it performs the following steps:

<br>
Copies Web Assets (dist/spa) to Native Platforms

<br>It then copies the built web files (index.html, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) into each native platform’s web runtime directory:

<br>For Android → android/app/src/main/assets/public/
<br>For iOS → ios/App/public/




<br>
Updates Dependencies for Installed Plugins

<br>It looks at package.json to find any installed Capacitor plugins (e.g., @capacitor/camera, @capacitor/geolocation).
<br>Then, it ensures that the native Android/iOS projects include those plugins.


<br>
Runs npx cap copy Automatically

<br>This is the same as running npx cap copy manually, meaning it updates the web assets in the native platforms.


<br>
Runs npx cap update Automatically

<br>It checks for any new Capacitor dependencies and updates the Android/iOS native projects accordingly.


<br>
Ensures Android/iOS Project Files are in Sync<br>
- It updates native platform files, such as AndroidManifest.xml and Info.plist, with any configuration changes from your Capacitor plugins.<br>
Optionally, you can run npx cap sync android in the /src-capacitor folder to specifically sync the Android platform.


**How capacitor.config.json is Used<br>
Your capacitor.config.json file contains essential project settings:

<br>appId: "com.abcdefg.gmap"

<br>This is the unique application identifier (package name for Android, bundle ID for iOS).


<br>appName: "quasargooglemap"

<br>The display name of your app.


<br>webDir: "dist/spa"

<br>This tells Capacitor where to find the built web files.
<br>Since you're using Quasar, "dist/spa" is the directory where Quasar compiles the production build of your app.



Why is this important?

<br>npx cap sync relies on webDir to copy files to the native platforms.
<br>If your Quasar build output changes (e.g., if you're using dist/pwa instead of dist/spa), you'd need to update webDir.

<br>Directory /src-capacitor importance

Running npx cap sync in the root directory of your Quasar-Capacitor project doesn't work because Quasar manages the Capacitor integration differently from a standard Capacitor project. Here's why:

<br>
Quasar's project structure: Quasar isolates Capacitor-related files in the /src-capacitor directory, including the relevant capacitor.config.json file.

<br>
Capacitor configuration: The capacitor.config.json file in the /src-capacitor folder is the one Capacitor uses directly when building and running our app.

<br>
Quasar CLI integration: Quasar CLI handles the Capacitor sync process when you run commands like quasar dev -m capacitor or quasar build -m capacitor.


<br>List of npx capacitor commands
Core Capacitor Commands
These are the main commands used for managing Capacitor in your project:

<br>npx cap init [appName] [appId]<br>
Initializes Capacitor in your project by creating a capacitor.config.ts/json file.<br>

<br>npx cap add [platform]<br>
Adds a Capacitor platform (ios, android, web) to your project.<br>
Example:<br>
npx cap add android<br>

<br>npx cap update<br>
Updates Capacitor and all installed plugins to the latest compatible version.<br>

<br>npx cap sync<br>
Copies web assets (dist folder) to the native platform directories and updates dependencies.

<br>This should be run after making changes to web assets or Capacitor plugins.


<br>npx cap copy<br>
Only copies web assets to the native platforms but does not update dependencies.

<br>Use this when you update frontend code but don’t need to reinstall plugins.


<br>npx cap open [platform]<br>
Opens the native IDE for the given platform.

<br>Example:
  sh
  CopyEdit
  npx cap open android  # Opens Android Studio npx cap open ios      # Opens Xcode<br>





 Development &amp; Debugging Commands
These help with debugging and running your app:

<br>npx cap doctor<br>
Checks for common issues in your Capacitor project setup.<br>

<br>npx cap run [platform]<br>
Builds the app and runs it on a connected device or emulator.

<br>Example:
  sh
  CopyEdit
  npx cap run android<br>



<br>npx cap serve<br>
Serves the web app locally for testing (useful for capacitor:// or http:// debugging).<br>



Plugin &amp; Configuration Management
Useful for managing Capacitor plugins and settings:

<br>npx cap ls<br>
Lists installed Capacitor platforms and plugins.<br>

<br>npx cap plugin add [plugin-name]<br>
Installs a Capacitor plugin.<br>
Example:
  sh
  CopyEdit
  npx cap plugin add @capacitor/geolocation<br>

<br>npx cap plugin rm [plugin-name]<br>
Removes a Capacitor plugin.<br>

<br>npx cap migrate<br>
Migrates Capacitor config files from JSON to TypeScript (if needed).<br>



Platform-Specific Commands
These commands apply to a specific platform:

<br>npx cap copy [platform]<br>
Copies only web assets to the specified platform.<br>

<br>npx cap sync [platform]<br>
Syncs web assets and updates dependencies for a single platform.<br>
Example:
  sh
  CopyEdit
  npx cap sync android<br>

<br>npx cap open [platform]<br>
Opens the corresponding native project in its IDE.<br>



 Troubleshooting Tip
If you are facing issues with Capacitor commands, try:<br>
npx cap doctor<br>
This will scan for common misconfigurations.
<br><br>At this point I highly recommend you inspect both package.json file, in project root and in /src-capacitor to insure the plugin is in fact installed. <br>Package.json screen shots
They should look similar to what's below. (Note: a slight variation in capacitor versions between root and /src-capacitor didn't seem to cause issues).
Package.json in project root:<br>
<img alt="json-root.png" src="quasarscaffold/json-root.png"><br>
Package.json in /src-capacitor:<br>
<img alt="jsonsrc-capacitor.png" src="quasarscaffold/jsonsrc-capacitor.png">
<br><br>And finally, always after installing plugins or making other updates, be sure and remember run in your /src-capacitor folder:<br>npx cap sync
<br>For notes about the npx cap sync command, reference <a data-href="#Part 3F - Sync Your Project" href="about:blank#Part_3F_-_Sync_Your_Project" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Part 3F - Sync Your Project</a> again for notes on "What npx cap sync does". <br>Wasn't that a journey! And now, finally you might actually be able to do some actual development.<br><br><br>To finally launch the app in development, run:<br>quasar dev -m capacitor -T android
<br>The above command translates/parses roughly as follows:<br>
<br>quasar:                Hey Quasar,
<br>dev:                      please launch a development server,
<br>-m capacitor:    in mode capacitor,
<br>-T android:        targeting android.
<br>When you run the above command, a session of Android Studio should automagically launch. <br>You should be able to interact with your app in Android Studio, and on the test Android phone at the same time.<br><img alt="androidstudio.png" src="quasarscaffold/androidstudio.png"><br><br><img alt="AndroidPhone.png" src="quasarscaffold/androidphone.png"><br>
When setting up your development environment:<br>
<br>You will plug-tether your test Android phone into your development machine via USB (MacBook, etc).
<br>Make sure your test Android phone has debug enabled.
<br>Make sure that wifi is enabled on your test Android phone.
<br>Make sure that your development machine (MacBook, etc) and the Android phone are on the same wifi network.
<br>Note that wifi in coffee shops, gyms, airports, etc often won't work!...some sort of port-forwarding security issue (TLDR...outside the scope of this document).
<br>Note that on the Android Studio you usually have to unplug the USB to your test phone and plug it back in to get it to hot-up and be recognized.
<br><br>Also: HIGHLY RECOMMEND: use the chrome inspect devices tool!<br>Open a browser tab, put in:<br>chrome://inspect/#devices
<br>When you launch the app you will be able to select your test Android phone and interact with it and show console log and review error messages from the WebView! This feature is so awesome!  <br>But, just a note: the inspect tool can be a bit balky...and it sometimes lags up to a few minutes before it brings up the device list.<br>
<img alt="chromeinspect2.png" src="quasarscaffold/chromeinspect2.png"><br>
=The Chrome Inspect tool is crucial. =<br>Chrome Inspect vs Android Studio
Per research: Your Quasar + Capacitor app is basically a web app running inside a native WebView. Chrome inspect is the tool designed to inspect WebViews. It’s basically poking inside the WebView as if it were a regular browser tab. 
Android Studio is great at debugging native Android code (Java/Kotlin).  It can see the device, it can launch and deploy your app, and it gives you full access to Logcat, which catches:

<br>Native logs (Log.d, Log.e, etc.)
<br>console.log() output only if it’s bridged properly via Capacitor/Cordova

Sometimes your JavaScript console.log messages do show up in Logcat — but not always clearly, and they can get buried in the noise.<br>
<img alt="ChromeInspect-Android.png" src="quasarscaffold/chromeinspect-android.png">
<br><br>And finally, now we can start adding Capacitor plugins that can work on a phone!  <br>There are so many cool features that Capacitor has to offer. Here's a link: <a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://capacitorjs.com/docs/plugins" target="_blank">https://capacitorjs.com/docs/plugins</a><br>Each time you add/install a capacitor plugin:<br>
<br>You may need to run an&nbsp;npm install&nbsp;in two places!
<br>Once in&nbsp;/src-capacitor, then again in the&nbsp;root.
<br>And you should carefully inspect both&nbsp;package.json&nbsp;files to confirm versions.
<br>And run npx cap sync in the src-capacitor directory/folder.
<br><br> Example: @capacitor/geolocation<br>Let's use the geolocation plugin as an example for how to go about installing a plugin into your scaffolded Quasar project (which again in Feb 2025: Quasar defaulted in cli and core at v6).<br>Some notes of @capacitor/geolocation plugin
.<br>
<a data-href="https://capacitorjs.com/docs/apis/geolocation" href="https://capacitorjs.com/docs/apis/geolocation" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">https://capacitorjs.com/docs/apis/geolocation</a>
The Capacitor geolocation plugin&nbsp;does&nbsp;not&nbsp;explicitly provide any map rendering or visualization capabilities.
The plugin uses the native features on your phone, or on your desktop machine to determine lat-long location data.
Also per research: The Google Geolocation API is a completly separate web service (part of Maps Platform) used for:

<br>Server-side location processing
<br>Cell tower/Wi-Fi triangulation without GPS
<br>Requires API keys and billing

Capacitor's plugin bypasses this Google Geolocation API by using direct device capabilities.
<br>Installing @capacitor/geolocation
cd to your project root, and run:
npm install @capacitor/geolocation@6.x

run in /src-capacitor folder:
cd src-capacitor
npm install @capacitor/geolocation@6.x

.<br>
The same pattern (appending @6.x) should work for all the capacitor plugins.
<br><br>More Versioning Rants
⚠️ Warning: Just blindly following the Capacitor documentation might get you into a versioning conflict.
Just running npm install @capacitor/geolocation will default in v7 (as of Feb 2025).
This v7 will conflict with the capacitor core defaulted in with quasar mode add capacitor command, which  defaults in capacitor-core at v6 (as of Feb 2025).
Oh, and good luck trying to find a comprehensive guide to a proper versioning for the software stack of:<br>
...Node,<br>
.....Vite,<br>
........Quasar,<br>
................Vue,<br>
....................Capacitor,<br>
..................... Capacitor-Android<br>
.........................Android-Studio<br>
............................Android SDK<br>
...............................Gradle<br>
.................................JDK<br>
.....................................Java &amp; Jetbrains<br>
......................................JVM<br>
.........................................Kotlin<br>
... there simply isn't any comprehensive guide as far as I could discern after many hours of flogging the internet. 
It's mostly trial and error. The documentation IMO is lacking.  Or it's just proof that I don't really know what I'm doing?  More probable: All programming is stuck in this version dependency purgatory...and we just have to suffer, because that is after all, according to Buddha, what life is about. 
This guide represents literally weeks of many, many scaffolding attempts to land a project that works (as of Feb 2025).

<br><br>Yes folks, yet more manual steps! Who said this would be easy? <br>For Android, you sometimes, but not always, have to manually update the AndroidManifest.xml file.<br>
Do your own research! <br>Example:<br>
Per Capacitor Documentation at following link: <a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://capacitorjs.com/docs/apis/geolocation" target="_blank">https://capacitorjs.com/docs/apis/geolocation</a><br>Find your AndroidManifest.xml file, which should be way down under:<br>
/scr-capacitor<br>
/android<br>
/app<br>
/src<br>
/main<br>For the geolocation plugin, per capacitor, put the following into the AndroidManifest.xml file:<br>&lt;!-- Geolocation Plugin --&gt;
&lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" /&gt;
&lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" /&gt;
&lt;uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.location.gps" /&gt;
<br><br>First let's just get a hello world MapPageGeoLocate.vue wired in,<br>
...we will replace the hello world with code that uses the geolocation plugin in the next step.<br>Dev &amp; Test from IndexPage.vue
Note that for dev &amp; testing I often create several versions of any given component...some times a dozen. So to facilitate that I use the IndexPage.vue as a default landing page, then use buttons to route to my actual pages.  Don't judge...it's just for testing.<br>
<img alt="IndexPage-TestExample.png" src="quasarscaffold/indexpage-testexample.png">
<br>Lets create an initial Hello World page under /src/pages folder<br>
...just to make sure the basic page, router and button work first.<br><br>Below is code for creating the CapacitorGeoLocate.vue in the /src/pages folder...again, we are just getting things wired up.<br>&lt;script setup&gt;
   // No setup needed for this simple example
&lt;/script&gt;
  
&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
     &lt;h1&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;
  
&lt;style scoped&gt;
   /* Add styles here if needed */
&lt;/style&gt;

<br><br>Add the following to the routes.js under the /src/router folder.<br>{
  path: 'geolocation',
  name: 'geolocation',
  component: () =&gt; import('pages/CapacitorGeoLocate.vue'),
},
<br>The route.js file should look like below:

<br><br>Add following to IndexPage.vue under /src/pages folder<br>&lt;q-btn
    color="primary"
    label="Go to just Geolocate Page"
    @click="$router.push('/geolocation')"
/&gt;
<br>The IndexPage.vue file should look like below:

<br><br>Test as both a SPA web page and in Android Studio<br>SPA - In the root directory run following terminal command.  <br>npm run dev

<br>After updating your code (and saving), test as both a SPA web page and in Android Studio<br>SPA - In the root directory run following terminal command.  <br>npm run dev
<br>You should see a web page with the button,<br>
...clicking the button should take you to the CapacitorGeoLocate.vue page:<br>CapacitorGeoLocate page as SPA

<br>Android Studio&nbsp;- In the&nbsp;root&nbsp;directory run the following terminal command.<br>quasar dev -m capacitor -T android
<br>You should be able to launch as an Android app in Android Studio.<br>

<br><br>Let me thanks Vueschool.io (link: <a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://vueschool.io" target="_blank">https://vueschool.io</a>) for their excellent video tutorials. They have a great product that really helped getting ramped up on Vue.js.  <br>Let me thank Luke Diebold in particular for his excellent video tutorials, as they gave a huge head start. Luke is just an outstanding educator and Quasar evangelist.<br>
<a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@LukeDiebold" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/@LukeDiebold</a><br>Also a shout out goes to all my AI friends, especially Perplexity (which offer links to it's sources!) and Claude which can produce fairly decent code. <br>
<br>Not once did these AI's ever roll their eyes and give back some sort of snarky answer to my endless questions about-the-same-dang-thing. 
<br>If I had to manually research each technical issue or question on Stackoverflow, or any of the other blogs, forums, etc, I could have been reading them till my eye-balls fell out of my skull and never emerged from the research rabbit-hole with any answers at all.
<br>So, apologies to all the kind people of the internet who selflessly contribute to the technical zeitgeist.  But without these AI's ability to distill their knowledge into specific answers, this project would have been absolutely impossible. Although the AI's are often frustratingly dead wrong, they also often nail the answers, and even the wrong answers sometimes offer important clues.  In fact, I fully expect this blog too will be consumed into the AI blackhole. <br>Oh, but I found Copilot in VS Code kinda useless...just say'n. This is as of Feb 2025, so I'm sure things will improve.<br>And let's give a thanks to Obsidian!<br>
<a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank">https://obsidian.md/</a><br>
I recently discovered this app, and it sure beats any of the other apps I've used over the years for taking notes.  <br>Be sure and install the Obsidian webclipper extension to your browser! Wow...it is sooooo useful. When you find a great web resource, just clip into Obsidian and it's there for you to research and link (tags) into all your other notes.  Also, in fact, this blog was produced in Obsidian. Obsidian is so useful, and it's free! Unbelievable.]]></description><link>quasarscaffold/quasarscaffold.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">QuasarScaffold/QuasarScaffold.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 15:31:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="quasarscaffold/logos.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;quasarscaffold/logos.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[README]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>Hello kind people of the internet.<br>This project attempts to create a software installation guide for getting a Quasar framework application initially scaffolded along with Capacitor to create an Android application.<br>This was created in Feb 2025 timeframe, so software versions quickly go stale-dated. <br>Never-the-less, if you are a newish programmer, and are also new to Quasar and Capacitor for creating an Android app, I do hope you find this guide helpful. ]]></description><link>quasarscaffold/readme.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">QuasarScaffold/README.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 18:37:38 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
