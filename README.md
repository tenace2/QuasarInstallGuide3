# QuasarInstallGuide3
Guide for scaffolding a Quasar and Capacitor app targeting Android with capacitor a plugin.

Hello kind people of the internet.  

I'm somewhat of a beginner/novice/dabbler with web programming (despite having years of experience in the technology sector), so this guide is mostly documentation for my own benefit.  

But, I tried to consider people who are attempting to get started with the frameworks, and include copious notes on that help explain what's going on. Any serious developer will probably find much of this guide off base, or even maybe mis-leading.  Believe me: I don't want to muddy the waters of an already complex subject (that I don't know nearly enough about). 

However, having a comprehensive guide would have really helped me when I was starting out.  So I do hope, this guide also helps you.

If you find this guide helpful, please add a üëç reaction and/or leave a comment to help me prioritize updates or clarifications.
